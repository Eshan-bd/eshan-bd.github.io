            <strong>Adversarially Robust Federated Learning Leveraging Confidence Score to Identify Retinal Disease</strong>
            <p>My undergraduate thesis, supervised by <strong>Dr. Zavid Parvez</strong> and <strong>Tanzim Reza</strong>, addresses the challenge of Byzantine attacks in federated learning, where malicious clients can undermine the global model. We developed a method that uses confidence scores to minimize the impact of these harmful updates while maintaining model accuracy. We tested the approach on a retinal OCT dataset, including images of age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema, and saw significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1 score for both InceptionV3 and VGG19. Our method offers a promising solution for improving the security and performance of federated learning models, especially in privacy-sensitive areas like healthcare</p>

            <strong>Encrypted Federated Learning for Detecting Skin Lesions</strong>
            <p>Working under the guidance of <strong>Tanzim Reza</strong>, I explored various image augmentation methods, including SMOTE, to address class imbalance issues in skin lesion datasets. Additionally, I implemented a BFV-based homomorphic encryption system within the federated learning framework, ensuring privacy-preserving training across distributed data sources while maintaining data security and model performance.</p>
