I am a **Computer Science and Engineering** graduate from **BRAC University**, Dhaka, with a focus on **Machine Learning**, **Federated Learning**, and **Privacy-Preserving AI**. Currently, I work as an **Software Engineer** at **Brain Station 23**, where I build scalable software solutions. My research interests revolve around advancing **machine learning privacy** and **security**, especially in **medical image analysis**, while also improving the **explainability** of AI models.

My undergraduate thesis, titled *"A Secure Federated Learning System Leveraging Confidence Score to Identify Retinal Disease"*, was published at the **2023 International Conference on Digital Image Computing (DICTA)**. I've worked on projects involving **medical image classifiers**, **homomorphic encryption** for secure federated learning, and **adversarially robust learning systems**. I am also passionate about developing **explainable AI** to ensure the transparency and trustworthiness of models, particularly in sensitive fields like healthcare. Moving forward, I aim to contribute to building **efficient**, **trustworthy**, and **secure** AI systems for high-stakes applications like **healthcare**, with a focus on **distributed machine learning** to enhance **scalability** and **privacy**.
